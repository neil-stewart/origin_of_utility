<p>Welcome to this decision making experiment, part of a project in the
Cognitive Science Laboratory at Warwick University. This experiment is about
how you feel about waiting to receive rewards. We'd like you to make a
series of hypothetical choices between delayed rewards. Each choice is quite
simple and involves making a choice between a smaller amount of money
available now or a larger amount of money available later on. Try to imagine
that you are making each choice for real. For example, consider the
following choice:</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="example_choice_0.jpeg"/></p>

<p>The left option offers &pound;200 in 1 week. If you choose the left
option, you'd be credited with &pound;200 in 1 week's time. You wouldn't
receive the money before then, but you'd definitely get it after 1 week.</p>

<p>The right option offers &pound;400 in 2 months. If you choose this option,
you'd get more money, but you'd have to wait longer to receive it. Which
option would you rather have?</p>

<p>We're going to ask you to make a series of choices. Here is an example
screen shot from the experiment.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="example_screen_0.jpeg"/></p>

<p>At the top of the screen you can see the delays and prizes on offer
throughout the experiment. These are there to give you an idea of what
options are available. Each choice will be presented on two buttons in the
middle of the screen. Think carefully about the choice and click the button
of the option you would prefer to take. The next choice will appear
automatically. The progress bar at the bottom of the screen will keep track
of how far through the experiment you are.</p>

<p>We will use the choices you make to try to get a better understanding of
the psychology of decision making. There are no correct answers and you
don't have to do any calculations - we are trying to discover your own gut
feelings. We are really interested in each choice you make, so please try 
carefully to imagine each option and make choices as honestly as you
can.</p>

<p>If you are happy to take part, please press "Begin" to get going. The   
experiment will take about 20 minutes to complete. If you need a break, you
are welcome to get up, go for a wonder, and then come back to finish the
experiment.</p>

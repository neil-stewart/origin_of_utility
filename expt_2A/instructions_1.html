<p>Welcome to this decision making experiment, part of a project in the
Cognitive Science Laboratory at Warwick University. This experiment is about
your attitudes towards risks and rewards. We'd like you to make a series of
choices between pairs of gambles. Each gamble is quite simple
and offers a chance of winning some money. For example, consider the
following choice:</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="example_choice_1.jpeg"/></p>

<p>The left gamble offers a 60% chance of winning &pound;400. To help you
understand this gamble, imagine a bag holding 100 tickets. 60 of the tickets
are 'winners' and the remaining 40 tickets are 'losers'. Imagine drawing a
ticket from the bag without looking. If you draw one of the 60 'winners'
you'll win &pound;400. If you draw one of the 40 'losers' you won't win
anything.</p>

<p>The right gamble offers a 80% chance of winning &pound;200. Imagine
another bag with 80 winning tickets, 20 losing tickets, and a prize of
&pound;200. Which gamble would you rather play?</p>

<p>We're going to ask you to make a series of choices. Here is an example
screen shot from the experiment.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><img src="example_screen_1.jpeg"/></p>

<p>At the top of the screen you can see the chances and prizes on offer
throughout the experiment. These are there to give you an idea of what
gambles are available. Each choice will be presented on two buttons in the
middle of the screen. Think carefully about the choice and click the button
of the gamble that you would prefer to play. The next choice will appear
automatically. The progress bar at the bottom of the screen will keep track
of how far through the experiment you are.</p>

<p>We will use the choices you make to try to get a better understanding of
the psychology of decision making. There are no correct answers and you
don't have to do any calculations - we are trying to discover your own gut
feelings. We are really interested in each choice you make, so please try  
carefully to imagine each gamble and make choices as honestly as you
can.</p>

<p>If you are happy to take part, please press "Begin" to get going. The
experiment will take about 20 minutes to complete. Please feel free to take
breaks as and when you need them.</p>
